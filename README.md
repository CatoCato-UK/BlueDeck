# BlueDeck
Software and Schematics files for the BlueDeck Bluetooth Media Controller

Powered by the Raspberry Pi 3a+, a Waveshare 320x240 px SPI LCD Touchscreen, and a custom controller PCB.
All files are open source, but please don't use them for a Commercial Product.

After its complete I may fix some bugs in the programming if any are reported, however I will not be actively maintaining and updating it. My code is trash I know, if you stumble across a huge bug then do report it. Otherwise just fix it yourself.
